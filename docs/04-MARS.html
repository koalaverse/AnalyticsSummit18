* .magenta[Single-layer feed-forward neural network:] `$$b_m\left(X\right) = \frac{1}{1 + \exp\left(-X^\top \beta_k\right)}$$`

* .magenta[CART:] `\(b_m\left(X\right) = I\left(X_m \in R_m\right)\)`

## Multiple linear regression

`$$f\left(X\right) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_1 + \dots + \beta_p X_p$$`

]

.pull-left[

.large[.green[Advantages]]

* Accurate if model is correct

* Interpretable for small `\(p\)`

.large[.red[Disadvantages:]]

* Inaccurate if model is incorrect

* Less interpretable for large `\(p\)`

* Global .red[parametric] modelling

* Limited flexibility

* Often need to compare multiple competing models

* Model assumptions need to be carefully assessed

* Blows up when `\(p &gt; N\)` üí£

## MARS basis functions

.large[

* MARS uses expansions in .red[*piecewise linear basis functions*] of the form

`$$\left(x - t\right)_+ = \begin{cases} x - t, &amp; \quad x &gt; t\\ 0, &amp; \quad \text{otherwise} \end{cases}$$`

.center[and it's mirror]

`$$\left(t - x\right)_+ = \begin{cases} t - x, &amp; \quad x &lt; t\\ 0, &amp; \quad \text{otherwise} \end{cases}$$`
* These functions are piecewise linear, with a .red[*knot*] at the value of *t* (i.e., they look like hockey crossing sticks üèí)

&lt;img src="Figures/04-Figures/04-basis-pair-example-1.svg" width="100%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;


---

## MARS basis function pool

.large[

* A basis function pair is constructed for each feature `\(X_j\)`, with knots at each unique value `\(x_{ij}\)`

* In total, there are `\(2Np\)` possible piecewise linear basis functions available for inclusion in the model

`$$C = \left\{\left(X_j - x_{ij}\right)_+, \left(x_{ij} - X_j\right)_+\right\}\\i = 1, \dots, N\\j = 1, \dots, p$$`

* The basis functions used in MARS are elements of *C* (.red[main effects]), or built up from products thereof (.red[interactions])!

]


---

## The basic idea

.large[

* MARS builds a model in two steps:

  - A .darkorange[*forward pass*] where pairs of basis functions (from `\(C\)`) are added in a greedy fashion (i.e., [forward selection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stepwise_regression))
    
  - A .darkorange[*backward pass*] where the least important terms are dropped from the model one at a time (i.e., [backward elimination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stepwise_regression))
    
* In the end, .red[an ordinary linear model is fit using *least squares* to the selected basis functions]

.center[however...]

# Why?


---
class: center, middle

.large[

Traditional stepwise procedures are often applied incorrectly!!

]

&lt;img src="Images/standard-errors.jpg" width="70%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;


---

## MARS: forward pass

.large[

* Analagous to [*forward selection*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stepwise_regression)

* Start with a simple intercept only model: `\(f\left(X\right) = \beta_0 = \bar{y}\)`

* Search for variable + knot combination that gives the greatest improvement to the current model

   - This requires trying all (mirror) pairs of basis functions
   
   - Improvement is measured using RMSE
   
   - Continue until largest model is reached (.darkorange[tuning parameter])

---

## MARS: backward pass

.large[

* Analagous to [*backward elimination*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stepwise_regression)

* After the maximimal model is obtained from the forward pass, switch to backward elimination

  - Remove basis functions .red[one at a time] (whichever one results in the smallest increase in RMSE)
    
  - MARS uses .darkorange[*generalized cross-validation*] (GCV) to suggest when to stop removing terms
  
  - This can be overridden by the user during training (e.g., *k*-fold cross-validation can be used instead)

---

## Generalized cross-validation

* .medium[GCV is an approximate form of .magenta[*leave-one-out cross-validation*] that]

  - .medium[Allows for .red[computationally efficient] model selection]
    
  - .medium[Provides more .red[honest model performance metrics] (e.g., *R*-squared for regression)]
    
  - .medium[Provides results that are consistent with ordinary `\(k\)`-fold cross-validation]

* .medium[When MARS selects terms to go into the model (forward pass) or removes terms (backward pass), the selection is typically made using the GCV results]

* .medium[For example, when MARS removes a term during the backward pass, it removes the term that gives the smallest increase in GCV error]


---

## Variable importance

.large[

* MARS can construct an internal measure of variable importance:

  - Calculate the decrease in RMSE for each subset relative to the previous subset during the backward pass

  - For each variable, sum these decreases over all subsets that include the variable

  - For ease of interpretation, the summed decreases are scaled so the largest is 100

]


---

## MARS vs. PPR and NNs

.scrollable[

.pull-left[

* PPR and NNs are .red[*universal approximators*]; however, this generality comes at a price

    - More difficult to interpret
    
    - Longer training times 
    
    - Model tuning is an art
    
* MARS offers a nice compromise!

    - Competitive predictive performance

    - Easier to interpret
    
    - Faster training times
    
    - Incredibly easy to tune
    
    - **Much easier to productionize!!**
    
    - Can naturally handle many types of response variables (not just Gaussian)

Refit the same model to the Boston housing data using .red[5-fold cross-validation], rather than the standard GCV statistic

(**Hint:** specify `pmethod = "cv"` and `nfold = 5` in the call to `earth()`)

  1. Do the results seem to differ much?

  2. Do the residual plots indicate any serious problems?
  
  3. Construct a PDP for the top predictor

## Tuning parameters

.large[

* MARS really only has two tuning parameters:

    - The maximum degree of interaction
  
    - The maximum number of terms in the pruned model (including the intercept)


```r
caret::getModelInfo("earth")$earth$parameters
```

```
##   parameter   class          label
## 1    nprune numeric         #Terms
## 2    degree numeric Product Degree
```

## Tuning parameter 'nprune' was held constant at a value of 100
## Rsquared was used to select the optimal model using the largest value.
## The final values used for the model were nprune = 100 and degree = 2.

Retune the previous MARS model using .red[*repeated 10-fold cross-validation*]. Do the results seem to differ much from those obtained previously using repeated 5-fold cross-validation?

(**Hint:** this can be done using `trainControl(method = "repeatedcv", number = 10, repeats = 3)` in the call to `train()`)
